# News-Bias-Detection
This project detects bias in news articles using NLP techniques and deep learning models like BiLSTM with Attention and DistilBERT. The dataset is processed through tokenization, feature extraction, and representation learning. The models are trained to recognize linguistic patterns indicating bias. Evaluation metrics such as AUC-ROC and confusion matrices assess performance. Hyperparameter tuning refines model efficiency for unbiased news classification.
